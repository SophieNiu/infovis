                        The formula illustrates the four main factors that
                        interferring with people's procrastination:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Expectancy: the perceived odds of getting a reward
                            and whether we expect success or failure
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Value: the pleasantness of doing a task, and the
                            size of its reward
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Impulsiveness: the tendency to get distracted or
                            lose focus on a task
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Delay: the time between the present and a task's
                            reward or completion
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        By creating the initial interactive illustration of the
                        formula, we can see how the formula help us visualize
                        our real procrastination behavior.

                <div id="vis"></div>
                <script type="text/javascript">
                    let jsonSpec = "data/procrastination_visual.json";
                    vegaEmbed("#vis", jsonSpec, {
                        theme: "latimes",
                        renderer: "svg"
                    })
                        .then(function(result) {})
                        .catch(console.error);

                <div class="description">
                    <p class="ideal">
                        In the ideal state, we would only work on the tasks as
                        we have expected to accomplish them and have some value
                        gained after completion.
                        <br />
                        Thus, as depicted by the purple line in ideal state, we
                        will work on building portfolio and doing homework.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ideal">
                        As we consider building a portfolio give us higher
                        value, we would start building from today, until when
                        the delay of doing homework gets shorter because the
                        deadline approaches, and we have higher motivation to do
                        homework. Once we passed the deadline for homework, we
                        would then go back to work on the portfolio to get the
                        expected high value return.
                    </p>

                    <p class="reality">
                        Yet in reality, we need to take all the temptations that
                        we have surrounded by us in consideration as well. On
                        the graph, I used texting friends and watching Netflix
                        as the constant temptation, which always have the stable
                        motivation(same impulsiveness and pleasure to do)
                        throughout.
                    </p>
                    <p class="reality">
                        Because we are going to do the thing that we are most motivated to do. We can see that the procedure that we will proceed is actually:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Texting with friends <br>
                                --->Deadline is far away. Our impulsiveness to get distracted is high.</li>
                            <li>Waching Netflix <br>
                                --->Possibly a show recommended by a friend, value drives the motivation high.</li>
                            <li>Rushing to do homework in the short amount time before deadline<br>
                                --->Delay gets super small, expectancy of completion gets super high)</li>
                            <li>Watching some more Netflix after the deadline to relax <br>
                                --->The delay again is large as deadline is far away, and the pleasure to build portfolio is lower than watching Netflix).</li>
                            <li>Building portfolio <br>
                                --->Job application season is here, must have something out.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class = 'reality'>
                        By showing the levels of motivation, we can easily see how our behavior is driven by motivation, and the text explains why we do so. <br>(The interaction of manipulating the variables is yet to come).
